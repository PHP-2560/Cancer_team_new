"Welcome to our website! With the incidence of cancer at an all-time high, 
it is imperative to learn about the associated risk factors in order to 
be better equipped to take proactive measures. According to 
the United States National Institute of Health (NIH), an estimated 1,735,350 
new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. each year and 609,640 people will
die from the disease in 2018 alone. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S., 
and scientists predict that as the current population continues to age, these numbers will 
dramatically increase. This will have a major impact on many aspects of society, including economics. 
The NIH reported that in 2017, national expenditure for cancer care was $147.3 billion, 
and this number is also likely to increase in coming years. 
Given the unsettling implications of this data, action is required. 
The good news is that a substantial proportion of cancer risks can be significantly mitigated."),
